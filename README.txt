DEPENDENCIES:
This entry just requires stock pygame. However it uses one mouse cursor system only available in
pygame 2.0.1, so running it on pygame 2.0.0 or below will result in an error.

This game is built for Python 3.6 and above, but it has only been tested on Python 3.7 and above.

RUNNING THE GAME:
The game can be run by executing run_game.py
Note: This pygame uses pygame.SCALED and the vsync setting in `pygame.display.set_mode()` to aim
to provide a better experience for different display sizes.

HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:
Since it is a tower defense, most of our controls are pretty self evident.
You click on towers to buy them, you click on a valid map space to place.
You click on a placed tower to see its information.

To scroll around the larger maps, you can use the arrow keys.

CREDITS:
All art was created from scratch by our team, along with many of the sound effects.
Obviously the game was created from scratch in stock pygame.
